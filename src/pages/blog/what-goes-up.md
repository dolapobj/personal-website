You've been out in the sweltering summer humidity for hours. On the inside, you're kicking yourself for only packing one bottle, which you foolishly finished during the first thirty minutes of your hike. With every step, your energy reserves seem to ebb from your body &mdash; soon, you'll be no more than an emaciated figure dragging up the rest of the path. Then in the corner of your eyes, you see it. As you finish the trail, the mountain peak reveals a broad valley, tucked away between the vast mountains. With the sudden rush of dopamine fueling you once again, you quickly whip out your phone and capture the scene &mdash; to later post to your Instagram story, of course.

As the high dissolves, you slowly realize your grim future: what goes up must also come down.
