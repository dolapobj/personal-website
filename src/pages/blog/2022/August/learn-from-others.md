As I shuffled through my reusable plastic bag, placing my groceries on the belt, I locked eyes with the cashier in front of me.

"*How are we doing today?* " I asked gently with a smile. Her alabaster cheeks quickly flushed with warmth. 

By the end of our brief conversation, I had learned that the woman had just started working at this Whole Foods three months ago, and that, surprisingly, we had grown up in the same small suburban town in central New Jersey.

I believe there is no human being from whom we cannot learn something if we are disciplined, patient, and interested enough to dig deep. At times, it can be a challenge, but the interest, no matter how obscured, is always present. By talking and engaging with people &mdash; particularly with those we may not encounter again &mdash; we allow ourselves the opportunity to gain insights and knowledge in areas and topics we might never find on our own. We open the door to opportunity,  serendipity, and most of all, we add fuel to one of the most valuable traits anyone can have &mdash; a fiery quality of curiosity and interest in the outside world.

There are often times when I would rather be alone and not engage with the people around me. However, more often than not, I find that if I allow myself to let go of that desire, I am more present, in the moment, and able to channel my curiosity to the people around me. The strangers, the elderly, the people with seemingly no immediate relevance to your goals and ambitions: in all these people is the oppurtinity to engage with others, fueling the interest to learn about the infinite types of human experiences and to better understand life. They offer the zeal to turn any mundane situation into a rollercoaster-ride-like adventure.

All it requires is a little bit of patience and courage. To engage and learn from others.
