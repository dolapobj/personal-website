"Dude, I love the way you bring up the energy in the room. You make the people around you feel welcomed, and I love that about you."

My friends are amazing people. They further my sense of curiosity, inspire me, and never fail to leave me with a gentle feeling of gratefulness for them being in my life. After time spent together, I constantly find myself reflecting upon, learning from, and genuinely appreciating the time we spent together. 

Yet, for some reason, I rarely share these feelings of admiration with them. Nothing feels better than a genuine, heartfelt compliment. Yet, to the people I love most dearly, I so rarely impart the same praise that I know never fails to boost one's confidence and warm one's core.  

I want to be better. My friends are amazing people, and I want them to know how much  I admire them. I want to be lavish, yet completely sincere with my approbation &mdash; more than anything, they deserve to know how grateful I am to have them in my life. Learning to compliment my friends.
