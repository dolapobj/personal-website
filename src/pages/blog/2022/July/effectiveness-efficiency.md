I was recently reading Tim Ferris's *The Four Hour Work Week*, where he discusses the difference between being **effective** and being **efficient**. Effectiveness consists of doing the work and tasks that bring you closer to your goals. Efficiency is completing a given task as economically as possible.

As I read Ferris's words, I was immediately brought back to my first year at MIT. From my first few computer science classes, I learned very quickly the best way to prepare for exams was to spend a fraction of my time revising class material (understanding the content from lecture) and spend the majority of my time doing practice problems (specifically, problems I hadn't seen before or found challenging). The rationale was simple: practice problems from previous tests and exams gave the most realistic taste of what to expect on the actual exam and, therefore, were the most *effective* use of preparation time. ***What*** I chose to spend my preparation time doing was far more important than ***how much time*** I decided to prepare. Efficiency is only important after targeting the most effective activities.

**Focus on Effectiveness.**

I ask myself, *"Am I working for the sake of working right now?"*


Focusing on effectiveness though mandates regular reflection. It requires me to be patient and mindful enough to take a step back and honestly consider the tasks that bring me closer to my goals. *Easier said than done.* I love to feel productive, and often the easiest way to feel productive is by filling my schedule with "fluff" &mdash; indiscriminate activities that superficially seem relevant but really don't bring me closer to my goals. If I can focus on the few most effective tasks, I can free myself to do less overall work with even better results. 

*Smarter, not harder.*
