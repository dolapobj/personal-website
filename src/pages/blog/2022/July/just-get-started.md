Other than getting a C on my first university physics exam (Paola you were a fantastic teacher, I just didn't study), what I remember most from weeks of studying mechanics and kinematics, is (unsuprisingly) **Newton's First Law of Motion**. He states that an object at rest will stay at rest &mdash; likewise, an object in motion will continue to stay in motion, unless acted upon by an external force.

When I find myself procrastinating, or struggling to muster the energy for a seeminlgy all-too-daunting task, Newton's words offer a bit of impulse &mdash; if I can just get started, things will get easier.  


So go ahead. Get started.
